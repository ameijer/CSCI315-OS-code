To select between the three possible allocation policies, the appropriate define statement should be uncommented at the top of the allocator.c file.

The three allcation functions APIs are as follows:

This function call will allocate the memory based on the First-Fit method. the size of memory to be allocated should be specified, as a size_t vlaue passed in size. A pointer to an allocatable slice of memory than can fit the target data should be passed in the void * targetspace pointer. This function will return a pointer to the allocated memory.
void *allocateFF(size_t size, void *targetspace){}

This function call will allocate the memory based on the Best-Fit method. the size of memory to be allocated should be specified, as a size_t vlaue passed in size. This function will return a pointer to the allocated memory.
void *allocateBF(size_t size){}

This function call will allocate the memory based on the Worst-Fit method. the size of memory to be allocated should be specified, as a size_t vlaue passed in size. This function will return a pointer to the allocated memory.
void *allocateWF(size_t size){}
